 Traditional cleaning cloths <b>leave streaks, a film of moisture or lint marks.</b>
<br><br>
It also means you have to buy <b>more cleaning products</b>, as the ones that leave marks are likely to make messes worse as they sit on surfaces while you work.
<br><br>
Nanofiber cloth is designed to be <b>100% streak and residue free</b> - to leave your surfaces clean and shiny, without overusing chemicals or adding more products to your environmental footprint.

The Nanofiber cloth is the new generation of cleaning cloths. It does <b>not contain any chemical agents and does not leave any oily film</b> or streaks. The Nano fibers instead ensure the surfaces are always clean and shiny but unlike the existing fabrics, do not leave any residue on the surface.
